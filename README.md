## Training and testing
To train the deep learning models used in the experiment, use the 'main_experiment.py' file and set the correct parameters. For example to run the same experiment in the paper, use the following python code in cmd.
```python
python main_experiment.py --Data "RMN1" --Mode Train>> ./results/results.txt
```

The testing is included in the previous command. However, to re-run the testing you can use 'main_experiment.py' as follows: 
- For overlapping data (The main dataset in the experiment):
```python
python main_experiment.py --Data "RMN1" --Mode Test>> ./results/results.txt
```
- For nonoverlapping data (The dataset used for ECG plotting):
```python
python main_experiment.py --Data "RMN2" --Mode Test>> ./results/results.txt
```

## Generating results and plots
The results, tables, and plots are not generated automatically in the testing process.

To generate result tables and boxplots use command: 
```python
python3 main_experiment.py --Data "RMN1" --Mode Eval>> ./results/results.txt
```

To generate ECG plots, use the following command:
```python
python3 main_experiment.py --Data "RMN2" --Mode Eval>> ./results/results.txt
```

You can remove the '>> ./results/results.txt' if you don't want the output of the codes to be written directly to 'results.txt' file. However, it is useful to keep it.
